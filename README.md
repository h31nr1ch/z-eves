## Why Z-EVES??

Neither I know why o for what you should use this shit... but let me tell you something...

You maybe need to use it. If you (like me) are studying Software Engineering at UADY. You will be prompt to use this shit. Yes you will.

This is a linux version (what I used to use) for z-eves. So, why linux? because Windows is a shit and with this z-eves shit the fucking shit is gonna happen... basically, z-eves close unexpectedly when you scroll.. yes my friend... you cannot scroll when using z-eves on windows. So please, use linux.
